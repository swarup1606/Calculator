## Installation

Make sure you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/swarup1606/Calculator.git
   cd Calculator
2. **Run the Calculator:**
   ```bash
   python calculator.py

## Usage
- Start the Calculator: Run calculator.py to launch the CLI interface.
- Input Your Expression: Type your mathematical expression when prompted (e.g., 2 + 2 or 3 * (4 + 5)).
- View the Result: The calculator computes and displays the result.
- Continue Calculating: Keep entering expressions until you choose to exit.
  **Example Session:**
    ```bash
    Enter expression: 3 * (4 + 5)
    Result: 27
